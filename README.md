## Legend of the Five Rings Dice Roller

**Exploding Dice**
Sometimes dice rolls yield a spectacular result. When a die comes up as a 10, it is rolled again, and the next
result is added to the dieâ€™s total. If the result is another 10, the die is rolled again until a result that is not a 10 is gained.

Example : A die rolls a 10 and then a 3. The result of that die is a 13.
Example : A die rolls a 10, a 10, and a 7. The result of that die is a 27.

**The Ten Dice Rule**
In the L5R RPG, characters can progress to a point where they are rolling large handfuls of dice, so much that it can become difficult to count and track them all. To keep matters relatively simple, no roll can ever use more than ten dice at a time. Additional rolled dice become kept dice at a ratio of one kept die per two additional rolled dice. If both rolled and kept dice already equal ten, then each additional die of both types converts to a bonus of +2 to the total of the roll. 

Example: A roll of 12k4 would become 10k5, because the two extra rolled dice that exceed the Ten Dice Rule become one extra kept die.
Example: A roll of 13k9 would become 10k10 + 2, because the two extra rolled dice that exceed the Ten Dice Rule become one extra kept die, and the additional odd rolled die becomes a bonus of +2.
Example : A roll of 10k12 would become 10k10 + 4, with each of the extra kept dice above the Ten Dice Rule becoming a bonus of +2.
Example : A roll of 14k12 would become 10k10 +12. Since both rolled and kept dice exceed ten, the four additional rolled dice become a bonus of +8, and the two additional kept dice become a bonus of +4, for a total of +12.
